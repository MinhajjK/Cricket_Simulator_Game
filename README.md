# Cricket_Simulator_Game
The cricket simulator game involves creating two teams with 11 players each and simulating a match over a predetermined number of overs, as specified in a configuration file. The game begins with a toss to decide which team will bat first, followed by simulating each ball being bowled with random outcomes such as runs scored, wickets taken, or dot balls. The scorecard is updated accordingly, and player dismissals are handled based on probabilities. After all overs are bowled or all players are dismissed, the innings summary is displayed. The process is repeated for the second innings, considering the target set by the first innings. At the end of the match, a summary is provided, including the bowler and batsman of the match, and the winning team is declared. Additionally, options to save and load match data are provided, and optional features like jumping to specific overs or introducing delays after each ball can enhance the gameplay experience.
